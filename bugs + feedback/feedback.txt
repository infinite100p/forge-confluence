request - ability to create new User via API (sandbox)
API should support new user account creation & deletion 
- dummy user accounts for development purposes under a single email address

Jira - creating new subtasks resets all previously set statuses for other subtasks 
^ bug or feature?

can't change email - tested in FireFox (hardened + default), Chromium

limited styling + positioning capabilities, flexibility, & functionality with Cloud
can't set table size, cell width & height (outside of custom UI scope?)

Atlassian dev community forum - many unanswered questions :(

Deprecated commands - update doc
